# Student Performance Analysis
## Project Overview
The main objective of the project is to analyze the student’s performance in an institution. I aim to identify the average score of students, their average dedication to reading and also their average sleeping time. The analysis also aims to show the performance of each department. This analysis was conducted using PowerBi from the beginning till the end.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis was gotten from Kaggle.com. It contains a well detailed raw information about the students’ activities and their performance for a semester in an institution.

## Results
My analysis results shows that :

•	The total number of students in the school is 5000.

•	Grade A is the students most have grade with an average score of 75.12.

•	The average sleeping hour of the student is 6 hours 54minutes everyday while the average studying hours is 17 hours 7 minutes after rounding up the milliseconds of each time.

•	Most students come from middle class family or low family.

•	Most students rated their level of stress as 4 in a scale of 10 followed by those that rated it as 8 in a scale of 10.

•	The department with the highest A is CS department while it is also the department with highest level of failure. Also it is the most populated department.

•	The number of students in each department contribute to the number of students having each grade. This shows that all department performance are almost the same.

•	The top 5 students of the institution are :
1.	Omar Jones (S1188) 1st 
2.	Sara Davis (S2652) 1st 
3.	Maria Brown (S4657) 1st
